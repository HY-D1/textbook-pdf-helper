# SELECT Statement Basics

## Definition

The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database. It allows you to specify which columns and rows of data you want to see.

## Explanation

The SELECT statement is one of the most fundamental parts of SQL. It enables you to filter, sort, and organize data in your database. Here's how it works:
1. **Specify Columns**: You can choose specific columns from a table or use an asterisk (*) to select all columns.
2. **Filter Data**: Use WHERE clause to filter rows based on conditions.
3. **Sort Data**: Use ORDER BY to sort the results in ascending or descending order.
4. **Limit Results**: Use LIMIT to restrict the number of rows returned.
5. **Group and Aggregate**: Use GROUP BY and aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG to perform calculations on groups of data.
When to use it: Whenever you need to access specific information from your database. It's used in almost every query you write.
Key things to remember:
- Always specify columns instead of using * for better performance.
- Use WHERE clause carefully to avoid unnecessary data retrieval.
- ORDER BY is useful for presenting data in a readable format.
Common pitfall to avoid: Not understanding the difference between SELECT and UPDATE. Selecting data doesn't change it, but updating does.
Best practice or tip: Always test your queries with LIMIT 10 first to ensure they're working as expected before running them on large datasets.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```sql
-- SELECT all columns FROM employees SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

This example retrieves all data from the 'Employees' table. It's useful for getting an overview of your data.

### Practical Example

```sql
-- SELECT specific columns AND filter by age SELECT name, salary FROM Employees WHERE age > 30;
```

This practical example retrieves the names and salaries of employees who are older than 30. It demonstrates how to specify columns and use a WHERE clause.

## Common Mistakes

### Using * instead of specific column names

**Incorrect:**

```sql
-- Incorrect way
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

**Correct:**

```sql
-- Correct way
SELECT name, salary FROM Employees;
```

**Why this happens:** Selecting all columns can be inefficient if you only need a few. It's better to specify the columns you need.

## Practice

**Question:** Create a query that selects the names and average salaries of employees in each department, sorted by average salary in descending order.

**Solution:** -- Solution
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM Employees GROUP BY department ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;
