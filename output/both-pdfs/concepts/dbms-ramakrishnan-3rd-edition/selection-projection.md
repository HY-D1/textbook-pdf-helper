# Selection and Projection

## Definition

Selection and projection are fundamental operations in database management that allow you to filter data (selection) and specify which columns to retrieve (projection). These operations help in managing and analyzing data efficiently.

## Explanation

Imagine you have a large library with many books. Selection is like choosing specific books based on certain criteria, such as genre or author. Projection is like deciding which pages of those books to read, focusing only on the information that's relevant to you. Both operations are crucial for organizing and accessing data effectively in databases.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```sql
-- SELECT all employees FROM the 'Sales' department SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'Sales'; -- SELECT only the employee ID AND name FROM the 'Employees' TABLE SELECT EmployeeID, Name FROM Employees;
```

These examples demonstrate how to use selection and projection to filter and retrieve specific data.

### Practical Example

```sql
-- Find all customers who have made a purchase over $1000 in the last month
SELECT CustomerID, Name FROM Customers WHERE PurchaseAmount > 1000 AND Date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH);
```

This practical example shows how to combine selection and projection with conditions to retrieve meaningful data.

## Common Mistakes

### Forgetting the WHERE clause in selection.

**Incorrect:**

```sql
-- Incorrect: SELECT all employees FROM 'Sales' SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

**Correct:**

```sql
-- Correct: SELECT all employees FROM 'Sales' SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'Sales';
```

**Why this happens:** Always include a condition in the WHERE clause to filter data correctly. Without it, you'll retrieve all rows.

### Selecting all columns when only specific ones are needed.

**Incorrect:**

```sql
-- Incorrect: SELECT all columns FROM 'Employees' SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

**Correct:**

```sql
-- Correct: SELECT only the required columns SELECT EmployeeID, Name, Position FROM Employees;
```

**Why this happens:** Only select the columns you need to avoid unnecessary data and improve performance.

## Practice

**Question:** Write a SQL query that selects all customers from the 'North America' region who have made more than 5 purchases in the last year.

**Solution:** -- Solution: Select required columns from Customers table
SELECT CustomerID, Name FROM Customers WHERE Region = 'North America' AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Purchases WHERE CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID AND Date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR)) > 5;
