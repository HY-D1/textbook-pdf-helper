# OUTER JOIN

## Definition

An OUTER JOIN is a type of join operation that returns all records from both tables, even if there are no matching records between them.

## Explanation

Imagine you have two sets of data - one for students and another for their favorite books. An OUTER JOIN would give you a list of all students, along with the book they like (if any). If a student doesn't have a favorite book listed, it will still show up in the result set with NULL values for the book details.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```sql
SELECT students.name, books.title
FROM students
LEFT JOIN books ON students.book_id = books.id;
```

This query will list all students and their favorite book. If a student doesn't have a favorite book, the book details will be NULL.

### Practical Example

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

This query shows all departments and their assigned employees. If a department has no employees, the employee details will be NULL.

## Common Mistakes

### Forgetting to specify LEFT, RIGHT, or FULL

**Incorrect:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1 JOIN table2;
```

**Correct:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON condition;
```

**Why this happens:** Always specify the type of OUTER JOIN you need. A simple JOIN without a keyword will result in an INNER JOIN, not an OUTER JOIN.

## Practice

**Question:** Write a query to find all customers and their orders, even if some customers haven't made any orders.

**Solution:** SELECT customers.name, orders.order_id
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;
