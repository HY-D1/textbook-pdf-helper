PREFACE The advantage of doing one's praising for oneself is that one can lay it on so thick and exactly in the right places. --Samuel Butler Database management systems are now an indispensable tool for managing information, and a course on the principles and practice of database systems is now an integral part of computer science curricula. This book covers the fundamentals of modern database management systems, in particular relational database systems. We have attempted to present the material in a clear, simple style. A quantita- tive approach is used throughout with many detailed examples. An extensive set of exercises (for which solutions are available online to instructors) accom- panies each chapter and reinforces students' ability to apply the concepts to real problems. The book can be used with the accompanying software and programming as- signments in two distinct kinds of introductory courses: 1. Applications Emphasis: A course that covers the principles of database systems, and emphasizes how they are used in developing data-intensive ap- plications. Two new chapters on application development (one on database- backed applications, and one on

the principles of database systems, and emphasizes how they are used in developing data-intensive ap- plications. Two new chapters on application development (one on database- backed applications, and one on Java and Internet application architec- tures) have been added to the third edition, and the entire book has been extensively revised and reorganized to support such a course. A running case-study and extensive online materials (e.g., code for SQL queries and Java applications, online databases and solutions) make it easy to teach a hands-on application-centric course. 2. Systems Emphasis: A course that has a strong systems emphasis and assumes that students have good programming skills in C and C++. In this case the accompanying Minibase software can be llsed as the basis for projects in which students are asked to implement various parts of a relational DBMS. Several central modules in the project software (e.g., heap files, buffer manager, B+ trees, hash indexes, various join methods) xxiv

PTeface XKV are described in sufficient detail in the text to enable students to implement them, given the (C++) class interfaces. r..,1any instructors will no doubt teach a course that falls between these two extremes. The restructuring in the third edition offers a very modular orga- nization that facilitates such hybrid courses. The also book contains enough material to support advanced courses in a two-course sequence. Organization of the Third Edition The book is organized into six main parts plus a collection of advanced topics, as shown in Figure 0.1. The Foundations chapters introduce database systems, the (1) Foundations Both (2) Application Development Applications emphasis (3) Storage and Indexing Systems emphasis (4) Query Evaluation Systems emphasis (5) Transaction Management Systems emphasis (6) Database Design and Tuning Applications emphasis (7) Additional Topics Both Figure 0.1 Organization of Parts in the Third Edition ER model and the relational model.

databases are created and used, and cover the basics of database design and querying, including an in-depth treatment of SQL queries. While an instructor can omit some of this material at their discretion (e.g., relational calculus, some sections on the ER model or SQL queries), this material is relevant to every student of database systems, and we recommend that it be covered in as much detail as possible. Each of the remaining five main parts has either an application or a systems empha.sis. Each of the three Systems parts has an overview chapter, designed to provide a self-contained treatment, e.g., Chapter 8 is an overview of storage and indexing. The overview chapters can be used to provide stand-alone coverage of the topic, or as the first chapter in a more detailed treatment. Thus, in an application-oriented course, Chapter 8 might be the only material covered on file organizations and indexing, whereas in a systems-oriented course it would be supplemented by a selection from Chapters 9 through 11. The Database Design and Tuning part contains a discussion of performance tuning and

whereas in a systems-oriented course it would be supplemented by a selection from Chapters 9 through 11. The Database Design and Tuning part contains a discussion of performance tuning and designing for secure access. These application topics are best covered after giving students a good grasp of database system architecture, and are therefore placed later in the chapter sequence.

XXVI Suggested Course Outlines DATABASE ~1ANAGEMENT SYSTEMS The book can be used in two kinds of introductory database courses, one with an applications emphasis and one with a systems empha..':iis. The introductory applications-oriented course could cover the :Foundations chap- ters, then the Application Development chapters, followed by the overview sys- tems chapters, and conclude with the Database Design and Tuning material. Chapter dependencies have been kept to a minimum, enabling instructors to easily fine tune what material to include. The Foundations material, Part I, should be covered first, and within Parts III, IV, and V, the overview chapters should be covered first. The only remaining dependencies between chapters in Parts I to VI are shown as arrows in Figure 0.2. The chapters in Part I should be covered in sequence. However, the coverage of algebra and calculus can be skipped in order to get to SQL queries sooner (although we believe this material is important and recommend that it should be covered before SQL). The introductory systems-oriented course would cover the Foundations chap- ters and a selection of Applications and

believe this material is important and recommend that it should be covered before SQL). The introductory systems-oriented course would cover the Foundations chap- ters and a selection of Applications and Systems chapters. An important point for systems-oriented courses is that the timing of programming projects (e.g., using Minibase) makes it desirable to cover some systems topics early. Chap- ter dependencies have been carefully limited to allow the Systems chapters to be covered as soon as Chapters 1 and 3 have been covered. The remaining Foundations chapters and Applications chapters can be covered subsequently. The book also has ample material to support a multi-course sequence. Obvi- ously, choosing an applications or systems emphasis in the introductory course results in dropping certain material from the course;
