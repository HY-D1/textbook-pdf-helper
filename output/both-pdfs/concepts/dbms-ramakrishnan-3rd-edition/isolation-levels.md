# Transaction Isolation Levels

## Definition

Transaction isolation levels define how transactions interact with each other and with data that has been modified but not yet committed. They are crucial for maintaining data consistency and preventing issues like dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.

## Explanation

Understanding transaction isolation levels is essential in database management because it ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other's work. There are four main isolation levels: READ UNCOMMITTED, READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ, and SERIALIZABLE. Each level provides a different balance between performance and data integrity.

READ UNCOMMITTED allows a transaction to read data that has been modified but not yet committed by another transaction, which can lead to dirty reads. READ COMMITTED ensures that a transaction only sees data that has been committed, preventing dirty reads but allowing non-repeatable reads. REPEATABLE READ guarantees that a transaction will see the same data repeatedly during its execution, even if other transactions modify and commit that data. SERIALIZABLE is the highest isolation level, ensuring complete isolation by ordering transactions in a way that eliminates all concurrency issues.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```sql
-- Set transaction isolation level to READ COMMITTED SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
```

This example demonstrates how to set the transaction isolation level in SQL. Setting the isolation level affects how transactions interact with each other and the data they read.

### Practical Example

```sql
-- Simulate a scenario where two transactions might cause a dirty read
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
-- Another transaction reads the updated value before it is committed
SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE account_id = 1;
```

This practical example shows how two transactions might interact at different isolation levels, highlighting the importance of choosing the right isolation level for your application.

## Common Mistakes

### Using READ UNCOMMITTED without considering the risk of dirty reads.

**Incorrect:**

```sql
-- Incorrectly set to READ UNCOMMITTED SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
```

**Correct:**

```sql
-- Correctly set to a higher isolation level like READ COMMITTED SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
```

**Why this happens:** Setting the isolation level too low can lead to data inconsistencies. It's important to understand the risks and choose an appropriate isolation level based on your application's requirements.

## Practice

**Question:** Explain how SERIALIZABLE isolation level works and why it might be necessary in certain applications.

**Solution:** SERIALIZABLE isolation level orders transactions as if they were executed sequentially, ensuring complete isolation. It prevents all types of concurrency issues but can significantly reduce performance due to the need for strict ordering. This isolation level is necessary in applications where data consistency is critical and concurrent modifications could lead to unpredictable results.
