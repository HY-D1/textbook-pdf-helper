# Transaction Isolation Levels

## Definition

Transaction isolation levels determine how transactions interact with each other and with data changes made by other transactions. They ensure data consistency and prevent anomalies like dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.

## Explanation

In a database system, multiple users can access the same data simultaneously, which can lead to conflicts if not managed properly. Transaction isolation levels help manage these conflicts by controlling how transactions see and modify data. The four main isolation levels are: READ UNCOMMITTED, READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ, and SERIALIZABLE. Each level offers a different balance between performance and data consistency.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```sql
-- Set transaction isolation level to REPEATABLE READ SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
```

This example demonstrates how to set the transaction isolation level in SQL. Setting it to REPEATABLE READ ensures that a transaction sees the same data multiple times during its execution.

### Practical Example

```sql
-- Start a transaction START TRANSACTION; -- UPDATE a record UPDATE employees SET salary = 5000 WHERE employee_id = 101; -- Commit the transaction COMMIT;
```

This practical example shows how to use transaction isolation levels in a real-world scenario. It starts a transaction, updates an employee's salary, and commits the changes.

## Common Mistakes

### Not setting the isolation level

**Incorrect:**

```sql
-- No isolation level set
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

**Correct:**

```sql
-- Set isolation level to READ COMMITTED
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
-- Then perform operations
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

**Why this happens:** Failing to set an isolation level can lead to inconsistent data readings. Always ensure that the appropriate isolation level is set for your transactions.

## Practice

**Question:** Which isolation level provides the highest level of data consistency and prevents all types of anomalies?

**Solution:** The SERIALIZABLE isolation level provides the highest level of data consistency and prevents all types of anomalies by ensuring that transactions are executed in a serialized manner. However, it can significantly impact performance.
