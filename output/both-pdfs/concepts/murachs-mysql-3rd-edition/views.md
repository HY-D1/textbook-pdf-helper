Creating and using virtual tables based on SELECT queries

## Explanation
360 Section 3 Database design and impleme11,tation, For most of the columns in these tables, I coded a NOT NULL constraint or a DEFAULT attribute. In general, I only allow a column to accept null values when I want to allow for unknown values. If, for example, a vendor doesn't supply an address, the address is unknown. In that case, you can store a null value in the vendor address 1 and vendor address2 columns. - - Another option is to store an empty string for these columns. To do that, I could have defmed the vendor address columns like this: vendor_addressl VARCHAR(SO} DEFAULT 1 ', vendor_address2 VARCHAR(SO) DEFAULT'', In this case, empty strings will be stored for these columns un]ess other values are assigned to them. In practice, a null value is a 1nore intuitive representation of an unknown value than a default value is. Conversely, it makes sense to use a default value like an empty string to indicate that a value is known but the column is empty. For example, an empty string might indicate that a

to use a default value like an empty string to indicate that a value is known but the column is empty. For example, an empty string might indicate that a vendor hasn't provided its street address. Although how you use nulls and empty strings is largely a matter of personal preference, it does affect the way you query a table. When a primary key consisted of a single column, I coded the PRIMARY KEY constraint at the column level. Similarly, I coded the UNIQUE constraint at the column level. As a result, I didn't provide names for these constraints. However, whenever I coded a primary key or foreign key constraint at the table level, I followed a convention that begins with the name of the table or an abbreviated name for the table. As you know, when MySQL creates a table, it automatically creates indexes for the primary key, foreign keys, and unique keys. MySQL uses the name ''PRIMARY'' for the name of the index for a table's p1imary key. It uses the name of the c

## Examples
### Example 1: SELECT Example
```sql
select the Alter Table item, and click on the Columns tab. • To rename a column, double-click on the column name and enter the new name. • To change the data type for a column, click on the data type in the Datatype colt1mn. Then, select a data type from the drop-down list that's displayed. • To change the default value

type for a column, click on the data type in the Datatype colt1mn. Then, select a data type from the drop-down list that's displayed. • To change the default value for a column, enter a new default valt1e in the Default column. • To change other attributes of the column, check or uncheck the attribute check boxes to the right of the column. • To drop a column, right-click on the column name and select the Delete Selected item. • To move a column up or down, right-click on the column name and select the Move Up or Move Down item. You can also use the Up and Down keys on the keyboard. • To add a new column, double-click in the Column Name column below the last column and type in a new name. Then, specify the attributes for the new column. • To apply the changes to the table, click the Apply button. To reverse the changes, click the Revert button.

364 Section 3 Database design and impleme11,tation, How to work with the indexes of a table Although MySQL Workbench provides several ways to work with indexes, one of the easiest is to right-click on the table in the Navigator window and select the Alter Table command to display the table defmition. Then, you can click on the Indexes tab to display the indexes of the table. For example, figure 11-11 shows the indexes for the Invoices table. In most cases, you'll use this tab to add indexes to a table. To do that, you start by double-clicking below the last index name and entering the name of the new index. Then, you can select the type of index you want to create, the column or columns you want to index, and the order for each column. To change or drop an index, you can use the skills presented in this figure.

### Example 2: SELECT Example

Then, select a type from the drop-down list that appears. Revert • To change the colu1nn that's indexed, select the index and then select its column in the list of columns that appears. You can also change the sort order of the index by clicking in the Order column and then selecting ASC or DESC from the drop-down list that appears. • To drop an index, right-click on the

order of the index by clicking in the Order column and then selecting ASC or DESC from the drop-down list that appears. • To drop an index, right-click on the index name and select the Delete Selected item. • To add a new index, double-click below the last index name and type in a new name. Then, specify the type, column, and order for the index. • To apply the changes to the table, click the Apply button. To reverse the changes, click the Revert button.

366 Section 3 Database design and impleme11,tation, How to work with the foreign keys of a table To work with the foreign keys of a table, you use the Foreign Keys tab. For example, figure 11-12 shows the foreign keys for the Invoices table, and the foreign key named invoices_fk_terms is selected. Here, MySQL Workbench shows the table that's refe1·enced by the foreign key, the foreign key column, and the column that's referenced by the foreign key. If you need to, you can change any of the information that defmes the foreign key as described in this figure. You can also add new foreign keys, and you can drop existing keys.

### Example 3: DELETE Example
```sql
DELETE statements that use them. How to work with the columns of a table Figure 11-10 shows how to work with the column defmitions of a table. To start, you can view the column defmitions for a table by right-clicking on the table in the Navigator window and selecting Alter Table to display the table in the main window. Then, click on the Columns tab at the bottom of the window. For example, this figure shows the columns for the Invoices table. Here, you can see the name, data type, and other attributes of each column. For

bottom of the window. For example, this figure shows the columns for the Invoices table. Here, you can see the name, data type, and other attributes of each column. For instance, you can see that the invoice_id column is the primary key column and an auto increment column. The payment_total and credit_total columns specify a default value of 0.00. And the pay1nent_date column allows null values and its default value is NULL. If you need to add a new column, you can double-click below the last name in the Column Name column. Then, you can type in a name for the new column, and you can specify its attributes to the right of the column name. You can also work with a new or existing column using the controls below the list of columns. In this figure, for example, I've selected the invoice_id column, so the information for that column is displayed below the column list. This is useful if you aren't familiar with the abbreviations that are used for the check boxes in the column list, since these attributes

is displayed below the column list. This is useful if you aren't familiar with the abbreviations that are used for the check boxes in the column list, since these attributes are clearly identified by the check boxes below the list. You can also use the Charset and Collation drop- down lists to change the character set and collation for some columns. You'll learn more about that later in this chapter.
