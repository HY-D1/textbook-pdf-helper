# The UPDATE Statement

Modifying existing rows in a table with UPDATE and SET clauses

## Explanation
144 Section 1 An introduction to MySQL A union that simulates a full outer join Afull outer join. returns unmatched rows from both the left and right tables. Although MySQL doesn't provide language for coding a full outer join, you can simulate a full outer join by coding a union that combines the result sets for a left outer join and a right outer join as shown in figu1·e 4-15. The example in this figure uses the UNION keyword to combine the result sets for the left and 1ight outer joins shown in figure 4-9. As a result, this example returns all the rows from the Departments and Employees tables even if these rows don't have matching columns in the other table. To make it easier to identify the unmatched rows, this statement includes the department_number column from both tables. This shows that two rows in the Employees table don't have matching rows in the Departments table, and it shows that one row in the Departments table doesn't have a matching row in the Employees table. In other words, two

have matching rows in the Departments table, and it shows that one row in the Departments table doesn't have a matching row in the Employees table. In other words, two employees haven't been assigned to a department, and one depa1tment doesn't have any employees.

### Example 1: SELECT Example
```sql
SELECT department_name AS dept_name, d.department_ n11mber AS d_ dept_no, e.department_number AS e _dept_no, last_ name FROM departments d LEFT JOIN employees e ON d. department_number = e. department_ n11mber UNION SELECT department_ name AS dept_name, d.department_number AS d_ dept_ no, e.department_number AS e _dept_no, last_ name FROM departments d RIGHT JOIN employees e ON d. department_number = e. department_ n11mber ORDER BY dept_name ► dept_name Accounting Maintenance Operations Payroll Payroll Payroll I Personnel Personnel (10 rows ) Description d_dept_no 01611 ffi991 1 5 3 2 2 2 4 4 e_dept_no last_name 6 Watson 6 locario 1 Hernandez 5 Hardy 001!1 lit!lil 2 Smith 2 Simonian 2 Aaronsen 4 Jones 4 Oleary • When you use afull outer join, the result set includes all the 1·ows from both tables. • MySQL doesn't provide language keywords for full outer joins, but you can simulate a full outer join by using the UNION keyword to combine the result sets from a left outer

146 Section 1 An introduction to MySQL Perspective In this chapter, you learned a variety of techniques for combining data from two or more tables into a single result set. In particular, you learned how to use the explicit syntax to code inner joins. Of all the techniques presented in this chapter, this is the one you'll use most often. So you'll want to be sure you understand it thorough! y before you go on.

Write a SELECT statement that returns all columns from the Vendors table inner-joined with all columns from the Invoices table. This should return 114 rows. Hint: You can use an asterisk(*) to select the columns from both tables. 2. Write a SELECT statement that returns these four columns: vendor name -

should return 114 rows. Hint: You can use an asterisk(*) to select the columns from both tables. 2. Write a SELECT statement that returns these four columns: vendor name - invoice number i11voice date balance due The vendor_name column from the Vendors table The invoice number column from the Invoices table The invoice date coltrmn from the Invoices table The invoice_total column minus the payment_total and credit_total columns from the Invoices table Use these aliases for the tables: v for Vendors and i for Invoices. Return one row for each invoice with a non-zero balance. This should return 11 rows. Sort the result set by vendor_name in ascending order. 3. Write a SELECT statement that returns these three columns: vendor name - default account - description The vendor name column from the Vendors table - The default account number column from the - - Vendors table The account_description column from the General_Ledger_Accounts table Return one row for eac.h vendor. This should return 122 rows. Sort the result set by account_description and then by vendor_name.

Chapter 4 How to retrieve data from two or m.ore tables 147 4. Write a SELECT statement that returns these five columns: vendor name invoice date - invoice number li_sequence Ii amount The vendor name column from the Vendors table - The invoice date column from the Invoices table - The invoice number column from the Invoices table The invoice_sequence column from the Invoice_Line_Items table The line item amount column from the - - Invoice_Line_Items table Use aliases for the tables. This should return 118 rows. Sort the final result set by vendor_name, invoice_date, invoice_number, and • • 1n voice _sequence. 5. Write a SELECT statement that returns three columns: vendor id vendor name contact_name The vendor id column from the Vendors table The vendor name column from the Vendors table A concatenation of the vendor_contact_first_name and vendor_contact_last_name columns with a space between Return one row for each vendor whose contact has the same last name as another vendor's contact. This should return 2 rows. Hint: Use a self-join to check that the vendor_id columns aren't equal but the vendor

contact has the same last name as another vendor's contact. This should return 2 rows. Hint: Use a self-join to check that the vendor_id columns aren't equal but the vendor _contact_last_name colu,nns are equal. Sort the result set by vendor_contact_last_name. 6. Write a SELECT statement that returns these three columns: account number - account_ description invoice id The account number column from the General_Ledger_Accounts table The account_description column from the General_Ledger_Accounts table The invoice id column from the - Invoice Line Items table - - Return one row for each account number that has never been used. This should return 54 rows. Hint: Use an outer join and only return rows where the invoice_id column contains a null value. Remove the invoice_id column from the SELECT clause. Sort the final result set by the account_number column. 7. Use the UNION operator to generate a result set consisting of two columns from the Vendors table: vendor_name and vendor_state. If the vendor is in California, the vendor_state value should be ''CA'';
