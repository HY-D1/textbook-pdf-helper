## Explanation
240 Section 2 More SQL skills cts you need them The date and time types Part 1 of figure 8-5 presents the five date and time types supported by MySQL. You can use the DATE type to store a date without a time. You can use the TIME type to store a time without a date. And you can use either the DATETIME or TIMESTAMP types to store both a date and a time. You typically use the TIMESTAMP type to keep track of when a row was inserted or last updated. For example, you might use this type to keep track of the entries on a blog. MySQL makes that easy by automatically setting the TIMESTAMP column to the current date and time whenever a row is inserted or updated. If that's not what you want, you can use the DATETIME type instead. The problem with the TIMESTAMP type is that it can only store dates up to the year 2038. This is known as the yea,-2038 problem, the Y2K38 probleni, and the Unix Millennium bug. As a result,

is that it can only store dates up to the year 2038. This is known as the yea,-2038 problem, the Y2K38 probleni, and the Unix Millennium bug. As a result, if you want your database to be able to store dates that go beyond 2038, you should use the DATETIME type instead of the TIMESTAMP type. Otherwise, you can use the TIMESTAMP type since it only reqtrires 4 bytes to store a TIMESTAMP value, compared to 8 bytes for a DATETIME value. If you need to store a year without any other temporal data, you can use the YEAR type. With MySQL 5.7.5 and later, the YEAR type stores 4-digit years from 1901 to 2155. Entries with one and two digits are still acceptable, though, and are converted to 4-digit years as indicated in this figure. Note that, by default, a numeric literal of O or 00 is converted to 0000. To store the value 2000 in a YEAR column, you must code it as a string. Prior to MySQL 5.7.5, the YEAR column could also store a 2-digit year.

0000. To store the value 2000 in a YEAR column, you must code it as a string. Prior to MySQL 5.7.5, the YEAR column could also 

## Examples
### Example 1: UPDATE Example
```sql
update the value manually as needed. • MySQL 5.7 .5 and later support only 4-digit years, which can be defmed as YEAR and YEAR( 4). I-digit and 2-digit years can still be entered but are converted to 4-digit years. Values from Oto 69 are converted to 2000 to 2069, and values from 70 to 99 are converted to 1970 to 1999. • For a value of O or 00 to be stored as 2000 in a YEAR column, you 1nust enter it as a string. Otherwise, it's stored as 0000. Figure 8-5 The date and time types (part 1 of 2)

242 Section 2 More SQL skills cts you need them When you work with the date and time types, you need to know how to code date and time literals. Part 2 of figure 8-5 shows how to do that. The default date fo1mat for MySQL is ''yyyy-mm-dd'', which is why we've used this forn1at in most of the examples in this book. By default, MySQL doesn't support other common date formats such as ''m.m/dd/yy''. If you attempt to use an unsupported format, MySQL returns an error. You also need to be aware of the two-digit year cutoff that's defined on your system. When you code a two-digit year, the two-digit year cutoff determines bow MySQL interprets the year. By default, MySQL interprets the years 00 through 69 as 2000 through 2069, and it interprets the years 70 through 99 as 1970 through 1999. Usually, that's what you want. However, the two-digit year cutoff can be modified if necessary. In general, it's considered a good coding practice to use four-digit years. That way, you can be sure that MySQL is

the two-digit year cutoff can be modified if necessary. In general, it's considered a good coding practice to use four-digit years. That way, you can be sure that MySQL is interpreting the year correctly. MySQL interprets any punctuation character in a literal as a delimiter between date parts or time parts. If you don't use any delimiters, you can code the value as a numeric literal. In that case, you don't need to use single quotes. When storing a date in a DATE column, the values are loosely checked for valid data. For instance, months must be in the range 0-12 and days must be in the range 0-31. For illegal dates, such as February 31, MySQL returns an error. However, MySQL allows you to store unconventional date values, such as ''2018-12-00'', which represents a month and year without a specific day. The default time format for MySQL is ''hh:mm:ss'', using a 24-hour clock. Many of the same rules for coding date literals also apply to time literals. For instance, you can use any punctuation character as a delimiter. Similarly,

using a 24-hour clock. Many of the same rules for coding date literals also apply to time literals. For instance, you can use any punctuation character as a delimiter. Similarly, for valid values, you can omit the delimiters. In that case, you can use a numeric literal (no quotes) instead of a string literal (quotes). Finally, MySQL checks times for validity. For illegal times, such as ''19:61:11'', MySQL returns an error. The default date/time format for MySQL is a combination of the date and time formats. Most of the rules for coding date/time literals ru·e a combination of the rules for coding date and time literals. In addition, if you don't specify a time when storing a TIMESTAMP or DATETIME value, the tim.e defaults to 00:00:00, which is midnight.

In most cases, you enclose the literal value in single quotes. • For dates, MySQL uses the ''yyyy-mm-dd'' format. For times, MySQL uses the ''hh:mm:ss'' format, using a 24-hot1r clock. • By default, MySQL does not support common date formats used by other systems such as ''mm/dd/yy'' and ''mon/dd/yyyy''. • By default, MySQL interprets 2-digit years from 00 to 69 as 2000 to 2069 and the years from 70 to 99 as 1970 to 1999. • MySQL interprets any punctuation character as a delimiter between date parts.

00 to 69 as 2000 to 2069 and the years from 70 to 99 as 1970 to 1999. • MySQL interprets any punctuation character as a delimiter between date parts. If you don't use any delimiters, you can code the value as a numeric literal without quotes. • If you don't specify a time when storiI1g a DATETIME or TIMESTAMP value, MySQL stores a time value of 00:00:00 (12:00 midnight). • If you don't specify seconds when storing a TIME value, MySQL stores 00 for the seconds. • When storing date and time values, MySQL loosely checks the values to make sure they are valid. For example, months must be in the range 0-12, days must be in the range 0-31, and so on. If MySQL determines that a date or time isn't valid, it returns an error. • MySQL 5.5 and later are stricter than previous versions of MySQL for storing date and time values. If MySQL can't interpret a value, it returns an error or a warning. Figure 8-5 The date and time types (part 2 of 2)

244 Section 2 More SQL skills cts you need them The ENUM and SET types The ENUM and SET types can be considered character data types since they allow you to restrict the values for a column to a limited set of strings as shown in figure 8-6. However, MySQL internally stores these values as integers, which reduces the nun1ber of bytes needed to store each string. The main difference between the ENUM and SET types is that an ENUM column can store exactly one value, but a SET column can store zero, one, or up to 64 different values. In other words, an ENUM column can consist of only one member in a set of values, while the SET column may consist of any, or all, members in a set. You can use the ENUM type to store values that are mutually exclusive, such as Yes, No, or Maybe. In other words, you can use the ENUM type to represent a choice of one value, but not two. For example, delivery or pickup;
