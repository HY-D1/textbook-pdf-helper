# Database Security

## Definition
Managing users, privileges, roles, and securing database access

## Explanation
520 Section 5 Database administration Perspective In this chapter, you were introduced to the responsibilities of a database administrator. In addition, you learned how to perform some of these respon- sibilities. For example, you learned how to monitor the server, configure the server, and work with log files. In the next two chapters, you'll learn how to perform two more critical responsibilities of a DBA. First, in chapter 18, you'll learn how to secure a database. Then, in chapter 19, you'll learn how to backup and restore a database. Although this isn't everything a DBA needs to know, this is enough to get started with the administration of many types of databases. In addition, it provides the background that you need for learning more about database administration on your own.

query log binary log relay log process mysqld program MySQL daemon status variable system variable 1. Start MySQL Workbench and open the Client Connections window. If the process list isn't displayed, click on the Refresh button in the lower right corner to display it. Review the list to see that it includes two processes for the current database. Then, return to the Home tab, open another connection for the root user, and select a different database as the current database. Next, return to the Client Connections window to see that it includes two additional processes for the new connection. 2. Use Workbench's Server Variables window to view these status variables: connections, threads_connected, bytes_received, and bytes_sent. Read the descriptions for these variables to get an idea of what they do. 3. Use Workbench's Se1-ver Variables window to view the sys

## Examples
### Example 1: SELECT Example

select a different database as the current database. Next, return to the Client Connections window to see that it includes two additional processes for the new connection. 2. Use Workbench's Server Variables window to view these status variables: connections, threads_connected, bytes_received, and bytes_sent. Read the descriptions for these variables to get an idea of what they do. 3. Use Workbench's Se1-ver Variables window to view the system variables named basedir and datadir. Note the paths to these di1·ectories. Then, view the system variables named log_error and log_bin. Note whether the log_bin variable is set to a value of ON or OFF and whether the log_error variable is set

Then, view the system variables named log_error and log_bin. Note whether the log_bin variable is set to a value of ON or OFF and whether the log_error variable is set to the name of an error log, indicating that it is on.

To do that, you may have to modify your operating system settings so you can see hidden directories and files. With macOS, you may also need to change the permissions for the directory to give yourself the read privilege. Note that the subdirectories of the data directory correspond to the databases that are running on yo11r system. If the data dil·ectory contains any log files, note the names of these files. 5. View the files in the AP subdirectory and note how the names of the files correspond with the tables of this database. To do this on a Mac, you may need to change the permissions for the directory to give yourself the read privilege for the directory. 6. Use Workbench's Options File window to enable the e1Tor log and the binary log, if they aren't already enabled. Use whatever directories and names you want for the logs. If you get an error indicating that access is

e1Tor log and the binary log, if they aren't already enabled. Use whatever directories and names you want for the logs. If you get an error indicating that access is denied, you may need to stop Workbench and run it as an administrator. After you enable these logs, restart the server. 7. Use the Explorer (Windows) or the Finder (macOS) to find MySQL's configu- ration file. Note the directory and name of this file on your computer. 8. Use Workbench's Server Logs wiI1dow to view the en·or log. Note that it includes messages about the startup and shutdown of the server. 9. Write and execute an INSERT statement that inserts a new row into the Invoices table. 10. Use a SET statement to temporarily enable the general log. Then, to make sure that this variable was set, use a SELECT statement to view the variable. If you get an error indicating that access is denied, you may need to stop Workbench and run it as an administrator. 11. Use a SELECT statement to select all rows from the Invoices table.

Use Workbench's Server Logs window to view the general log, and click on the Refresh button. Note that it includes the SELECT statement from the previous step. 13. Use a SET statement to disable the general log. Then, to make sure that this variable was set, use a SELECT statement to view the variable.

How to secure a database If you have installed MySQL on your own computer and you have only been working with sample databases, security hasn't been much of a concern. However, when you use MySQL in a production environment, you must configure security to prevent misuse of your data. In this chapter, you' 11 learn how to do that by writing SQL statements to create use1·s that have restricted access to your database. In addition, you'll learn how to use MySQL Workbench to perform many of the security-related tasks that you can perform with SQL code.

524 Section 5 Database administration An introduction to user accounts Before you leain the details of managing database security, you should have a general idea of how user accounts work. That's what you'll learn in this topic. An introduction to SQL statements for user accounts Figure 18-1 presents a script that contains the SQL statements that are used to create two users and grant them privileges. You'll learn more about how the statements in this script work later in this chapter. For now, we just want to introduce you to the concepts of users and privileges. This script starts with CREATE USER statements that create two users, named ap_admin and ap_user. Both users can only connect from the local server, and both have a password of ''pa55word''. Although this password isn't realistic, it illustrates how these statements work. After the users are created, the GRANT statements set up privileges for each user. Here, the user named ap_admin is granted all the privileges on the AP database. As a result, this user can select, insert, update, and delete data from the

each user. Here, the user named ap_admin is granted all the privileges on the AP database. As a result, this user can select, insert, update, and delete data from the tables of the AP database. In addition, this user has many other privileges such as creating or dropping tables, indexes, and views in the AP database. By contrast, the user named ap_user can only select, insert, update, and delete data in the AP database. If you want to view tl1e privileges for a user, you can use the SHOW GRANTS statement. In this figure, for example, you can see the privileges for the user named ap_admin.
