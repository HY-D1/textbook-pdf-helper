## Explanation
18 Section 1 An introduction to MySQL An introduction to SQL and SQL-based systems In the topics that follow, you '11 learn how SQL and SQL-based database management systems evolved. In addition, you'll lea111 how some of the most popular SQL-based systems compare. A brief history of SQL Prior to the release of the frrst relational database management system, each database had a unique physical structure and a unique programming language that the programmer had to understand. That all changed with the advent of SQL and the relational database management system. Figure 1-8 lists the important events in the history of SQL. In 1970, Dr. E. F. Codd published an article that described the relational database model he had been working on with a research team at IBM. Then, in 1979, Relational Software, Inc. released the first relational database management system, called Oracle. This RDBMS ran on a minicomputer and used SQL as its query language. This product was widely successful, and the company later changed its name to Oracle to reflect that success. In 1982, IBM released its first

In 1982, IBM released its first commercial SQL-based RDBMS, called SQUDS (SQUData S)1stem). This was followed in 1985 by DB2 (Database 2). Both systems ran only on IBM mainframe computers. Later, DB2 was ported to other operating systems, including Unix and Windows. Today, it continues to be IBM's premier database system. During the 1980s, other SQL-based database syste1ns, including SQL Server, were developed. Although each of these systems used SQL as its query language, each implementation was unique. That began to change in 1989, when the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) published its first set of standards for a database query language. As each database manufacturer has attempted to co1nply with these standards, their implementations
