## Explanation

Database design and impleme11,tation, 
How to nor111alize a data structure 
The topics that follow describe the seven normal forms and teach you how to 
apply the first three. As I said earlier, you apply these three forms to some extent 
in the first four database design steps, but these topics will give you more insight 
into the process. Then, the last topic explains when and how to denormalize 
a data structure.

When you finish these topics, you' 11 have the basic skills for 
designing databases that are efficient and easy to use. The seven normal forms 
that the previous forms have already been applied. Before you can apply the 
third normal form, for example, the design must already be in the second normal 
form. Strictly speaking, a data structure isn't normalized until it's in the fifth or 
sixth normal form.

However, the normal forms past the third normal form are 
applied infrequently. Because of that, I won't present those forms in detail here. Instead, I'll just describe them briefly so you'll have an idea of how to apply 
them if you need to. The Boyce-Codd normal form can be used to eliminate transitive 
dependencies. With this type of dependency, one column depends on another 
column, which depends on a third coltunn.

## Examples

### SQL Example 1

```sql
create a model from that script. To do that, you can click the 0 icon to the right of the Models heading and select the ''Create EER Model from Script'' iten1. Then, you can use the resulting dialog box to select the script file. Hovv to design a database The Models tab of the MySQL Workbench Home page ■ MySQl.

## Common Mistakes

### Not understanding the concept fully

**Incorrect:**

```sql
-- Incorrect usage
```

**Correct:**

```sql
-- Correct usage (see textbook)
```

**Why this happens:** Review the textbook explanation carefully

## Practice

**Question:** Practice using Third Normal Form (3NF) in your own SQL queries

**Solution:** Try writing queries and compare with textbook examples
