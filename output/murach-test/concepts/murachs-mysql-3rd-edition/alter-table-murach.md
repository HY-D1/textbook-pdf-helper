You can also use a 
CASE ( computer-aided software engineering) tool if one is available to you.

After you identify and subdivide all of the data elements for a database, you should 
group them by the entities with which they're associated.

These entities will later 
become the tables of the database, and the elements will become the columns. • 
If a data element relates to more than one entity, you can include it under all of the 
entities it relates to. Then, when you normalize the database, you may be able to 
remove the duplicate elements. • 
As you assign the elements to entities, you should omit elements that aren't needed, 
and you should add any additional elements that are needed.

The notation used in this figure 
• 
Data elements that were previously identified but aren't needed are crossed out. • 
Data elements that were added are displayed in italics. • 
Data elements that are related to two or more entities are followed by an asterisk. • 
You can use a similar notation or develop one of your own. You can also use a 
CASE ( computer-aided software engineering) tool if one is available to you.

## Examples

### Example

```sql
-- See textbook for complete examples
```

## Common Mistakes

### Not understanding the concept fully

**Incorrect:**

```sql
-- Incorrect usage
```

**Correct:**

```sql
-- Correct usage (see textbook)
```

**Why this happens:** Review the textbook explanation carefully
