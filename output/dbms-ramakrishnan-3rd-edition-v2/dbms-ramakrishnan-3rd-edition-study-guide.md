## part 3

**Definition:** print ("</HTML>"); exit; Figure 7.16 A Simple Perl Script specialized programs called application servers.

### Explanation
print ("</HTML>"); exit; Figure 7.16 A Simple Perl Script specialized programs called application servers. An application server main- tains a pool of threads or processes and uses these to execute requests. Thus, it avoids the startup cost of creating a new process for each request. Application servers have evolved into flexible middle-tier packages that pro- vide many functions in addition to eliminating the process-creation overhead.

They facilitate concurrent access to several heterogeneous data sources (e.g., by providing JDBC drivers), and provide session management services. Often, business processes involve several steps. Users expect the system to maintain continuity during such a multistep session. Several session identifiers such as cookies, URI extensions, and hidden fields in HTML forms can be used to identify a session.

Application servers provide functionality to detect when a session starts and ends and keep track of the sessions of individual users. They

## Active transactions

**Definition:** Empirically, thrashing is seen to occur when 30% of active transactions are blocked, and a DBA should monitor the fraction of blocked transactions to see if the system is at risk of thrashing.

### Explanation
Figure 16.9 Lock Thrashing If a database system begins to thrash, the database administrator should reduce the number of transactions allowed to run concurrently. Empirically, thrashing is seen to occur when 30% of active transactions are blocked, and a DBA should monitor the fraction of blocked transactions to see if the system is at risk of thrashing. Throughput can be increa..c;ed in three ways (other than buying a fa..'3ter system): IIll By locking the smallest sized objects possible (reducing the likelihood that two transactions need the same lock).

.. By reducing the time that transaction hold locks (so that other transactions are blocked for a shorter time). 3Ivlany common deadlocks can be avoided using a technique called lock downgrade8, implemented in most cOlnmercial systems (Section 17.3).

## of CPUs, # transactions per second

**Definition:** A relational query execution plan is a graph of relational algebra operators, and the operators in a graph can be executed in parallel.

### Explanation
Figure 22.2 Speed-up and Scale-up execution of rnultiple queries, it is hard to identify in advance which queries will run concurrently. So the ernphasis has been on parallel execution of a single query. A relational query execution plan is a graph of relational algebra operators, and the operators in a graph can be executed in parallel. If one operator consurnes the output of a second operator, we have pipelined parallelism (the output of the second operator is worked on by the first operator as soon as it is generated); if not, the two operators can proceed esseptially independently.

An operator is said to block if it produces no output until 'it has conSUllled all its inputs. Pipelined parallelisrn is lirnited by the presence of operators (e.g., sorting or aggregation) that block. In addition to evaluating different operators in parallel, we can evaluate each individual operator in a query plan in a parallel fashion. rrhe key to evaluating an operator in pa,rallel is to partition the input data; \ve can then work on each partition in parallel and cornbine the results.

This approach is called data-partitioned parallel evaluation. By exercising sorne care, existing code for sequentially evaluating relational operators can be ported easily for data-partitioned parallel evaluation. All inlportant observation, '\vhich explains vvhy shaxed-nothing parallel databa",;c systelns have been very successful, is that database query evaluation is very axncll<tble to data-partitioned parallel evaluation.

### Key Points
- So the ernphasis has been on parallel execution of a single query.
- A relational query execution plan is a graph of relational algebra operators, and the operators in a graph can be executed in parallel.

The enhanced functionality of OIlDBIvlSs raises several irnp1ernentation chal-

**Definition:** SOlne of these are 'well understood and solutions have been irnp1enlented in products; others are subjects of current research.

### Explanation
lenges. SOlne of these are 'well understood and solutions have been irnp1enlented in products; others are subjects of current research. In this section \ve exarnine a few of the key challenges that arise in irnplernenting an efficient, fully func- tional OIlDBlvfS. l\:lany rnore issues are involved than those discussed here; the I.- , interested reader is encouraged to revisit the previous chapters in this book and consider whether the irnplernentation techniques described there apply natu- rally to ORDBJ\JISs or not.

23.8.1 Storage and Access Methods Since object-relational databases store new types of data, ORDBMS imple- rnentors need to revisit some of the storage and indexing issues discussed in earlier chapters. In particular, the system lllust efficiently store ADT objects and structured objects and provide efficient indexed access to both. Storing Large ADT and Structured Type Objects Large ADT objects and structured objects cornplicate the layout of data on disk.

This problern is well understood and has been solved in essentially all ORDBMSs and OODBMSs. We present Sallie of the main issues here. User-defined ADTs can be quite la,rge. In particular, they can be bigger than a single disk page. Large ADTs, like BLOBs, require special storage, typically in a different location on disk frorn the tuples that contain them. Disk-based pointers are rnaintained frorn the tuples to the objects they contain.
