Application servers have evolved into flexible middle-tier packages that pro- vide many functions in addition to eliminating the process-creation overhead.

They facilitate concurrent access to several heterogeneous data sources (e.g., by providing JDBC drivers), and provide session management services. Often, business processes involve several steps. Users expect the system to maintain continuity during such a multistep session.
